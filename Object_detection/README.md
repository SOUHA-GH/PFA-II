## **In this folder, you will find:**
- A Camera Test
- Motion Detection
- Object Detection using Neural Network (TensorFlow Lite)
- Face Detection and Tracking (Detecting face using Harr Cascade detector)
  1. Color-based Object Detection and Tracking
  2. Shape-based Object Detection and Tracking
  3. Feature-based Object Detection and Tracking (with ORB : Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

For object detection, to detect and track an object using its feature,
The algorithm selected here is ORB,for its fast calculation speed to enable real-time detection. 
To use the example, please prepare an object in hand (and place its picture as "simple.png" in the folder).</p>
